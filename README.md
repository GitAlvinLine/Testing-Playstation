# Testing Playstation Features

For this testing, I am using Selenium Webdriver and Unittesting.
This is a little fun introduction experiement that I did for getting an understanding of Selenium and testing. 
This test file is going to the home page of the Playstation website,
and testing to see if the word "PlayStation" is in the <title> tag of the html file.
